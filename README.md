## Overview
This repository contains code for the 3 experiments presented in the paper. </br>
- Experiment 1 highlights the learning process involved in adaptive patch foraging and analysis of the learned agent at various stages of training. </br>
- Experiment 2 presents an analysis of evidence accumulation mechanism observed in the adaptive agent. </br>
- Experiment 3 presents an analysis of change in average patch residing time of the adaptive agent with respect to change in growth rate of the resources in the environment.</br>
